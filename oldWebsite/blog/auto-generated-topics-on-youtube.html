						I just read a <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-way-to-find-the-playlist-with-a-video-I-posted-on-YouTube">question about YouTube on Quora</a>. Somebody searched for a way to find a video inside a playlist. That was the reason I started to search for one of my videos inside the YouTube-Search. I started with a few words and continued to add some more till I got some results that included one of my videos.

						I was impressed to find my videos on a playlist of somebody else and tried to get some more information about the channel.
						
						<ul>

										Rock im Park - Topic
									</strong>
								</a>
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOkzcCkOtmmuE8f5FCC8ipA/featured"><strong>
									Rock im Park 2017 - Topic
								</strong>
								</a>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<br>
						It didn’t belong to anybody, it was auto-generated by YouTube. The „About“ page pointed me <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2579942">to the support page of google</a> explaining how the autogenerated topic channels are created and why.

						<br><br>

						This way you get promoted by YouTube through these playlist's. They will show up as a recommendation from YouTube. Dependent on the Topic and your content, the video will be added. There is no clear definition how YouTube works ( ans usual.)

					<h4>Google's opinion about auto-generated playlist's</h4>
					<p>
						I also searched for <a href="https://www.google.de/search?q=%22Auto-generated+topic+channels%22&oq=%22Auto-generated+topic+channels%22&aqs=chrome..69i57j0.3896j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">this topic on Google</a> and didn't find many results. But here is a short summary of the facts I got

								Somebody on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/61pmtz/why_are_auto_generated_topic_channels_videos_so/">wrote a post about getting dislike's</a> on the video just because it is included in one of the auto-generated playlist's. Had been written, 4 months before.

							<li>
								On <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37348412/how-to-find-if-a-channel-is-auto-generated-topic-by-youtube">Stackoverflow, somebody asked about a possibility to search for these auto-generated playlists. There is just one answer. You have to check the "About" page and looking for the link from Google, that points to the support page. The

								Some last good facts: It's about keywords. That's what <a href="http://yttalk.com/threads/auto-generated-topic-channels-for-better-traffic.261814/">the people on yttalk.com say!</a>
							</li>

							<li>
								On the Google Forum somebody asked, <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/youtube/8AnQO7KnkCQ;context-place=topicsearchin/youtube/authorid$3AAPn2wQeF-jc8BRyyccKdE-mbHLbhCmnpd0su5QXkQzCPd7M_wvOKHA4cMsD5wiaFPCxJ1UezgiBs%7Csort:date%7Cspell:false">if it is possible to delete a video from such a playlist</a>.<br>
